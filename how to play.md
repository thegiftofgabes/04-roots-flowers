# Roots & Flowers

In a not-so-distant future, we gave up the illusion of knowing better. This opened new avenues in technological innovation, improving life, and opening our awareness of the subtle, ancestral magic of the world.

You are the local community's troubleshooters. Your community turns to you for aid in things big and small. You resolve them by means of innovation, knowledge, technology, mediation, and ancestral guidance.

**Player Goals:**

-   aid and support your community;
-   go on wild, fun, solarpunk adventures;
-   imagine a possible future.

## The World Before

Much has changed after what is collectively known as the World Before, a time before civilisation turned away from a global culture of colonisation, destruction and environmental chaos, complete disregard for life, human or otherwise, and cannibalistic individualism.

It was not easy, people changed, civilisation changed, and humans sought to repair the damage caused to the planet. Most of that exists only as ruin or relics, called The Legacy.

While technology advanced at an incredible rate, specially as collective efforts turned towards health, sustainability and efficient means of generation and consumption of energy, not all damage was healed. After all, if you break a pot and glue it back, it will still retain the cracks from its fall.

This is an age of exploration -- the exploration of self, identity, and gender, of the relations between humanity and its more-than human counterpart called Nature, of what it means to be a community, and of the endless possibilities of futures we want.

## The Legacy

Relics from the World Before, technology, records, buildings, structures, as well as all damage caused, all of that is simply referred to as The Legacy. Most of The Legacy has been recycled, repurposed and redesigned over time, but in some places, the Wild has never quite recovered, and some things are, to this day, way too dangerous to approach.

Remnants of the legacy are found in contemporary life, quirky things to play around with.

In adventures about The Legacy, players may choose to encounter things they wish to get back at, such as war things and other tools of suffering and oppression. This is a chance to reawaken them, so they can unmake them once for all, or see any other end they desire.

##  Ancestry

Old recipes from someone's gran gran, the elderly of the community, the stories untold by the land itself or the millenia-old cultures and traditions brought forth from indigenous peoples, are all forms in which Ancestry manifests. And there is a subtle, gentle magic that comes from it.

Ancestry allows players to express their own connection with the past and how it guides and shapes their future.

In adventures around Ancestry, the players may explore how traditions survive, how we relate to the elderly and how we use this knowledge to look forward. Players may also explore their own ancestral roots to indigenous peoples and nations, and explore how they thrive and inspire the community.

## Magic

Ancestral Magic is subtle, kindly and accessible to all. A stew made to cure a cold could be infused with magic through reverence of passed down cooking recipies. An explorer could feel how the Wild around whispers to all of those who allow themselves to listen, and find paths before unknown. A Teacher could turn their teaching grounds into a magical place of connection and empathy through careful preparation and attention to those who come to attend.

When expressing Ancestral Magic, tell the other players how it manifests and ask the others whether it wants to manifest then and there, and what it will do.

It cannot miraculously cure a wound or lift a boulder, but it can show things hidden, soothe someone's suffering or aid in unobtrusive, gentle ways.

6. **Choose a special gadget:** a portable super computer; a multimedia 3d projector; an advanced toolkit; a MedPAC; a universal analyser; a vibro-cutter; a small AI drone.

7. Complete the sentence below with the information you chose. Sprinkle in as much detail and personality as you feel like.

## Create a Community

As a group choose two characteristics of the community you live in: close-knit, self-sufficient, plenty of natural resources, spacious, a great learning center, a great community center, ancestral guidance, diverse means of communication, accessible architecture, a culture of proactivity.

Choose one challenge the community faces: great distances, unbalanced resource management, isolation, environmental legacy, poor infrastructure.

Give your community a name.

## Example Community

The Baobab Community is Close-knit and boasts a culture of proactivity.

Our biggest challenge is the environmental legacy from the World Before.

##  Roll the Dice

When you do something challenging, uncertain, or bold, roll 1d6 to find out how it goes. Also:

-   If your role applies to the roll, roll +1d6.

-   If your trait applies to the roll, roll +1d6.

-   If your character goal aligns with your course of action, roll +1d6.

-   If you have appropriate equipment for the task, roll +1d6.

-   If you act upon an answer you got from a WILD roll, add +1d6.

When you roll your dice, compare each die result to your number.

**If you're using FLOWERS** (sensibility, soft approaches, inner magic), you want to roll under your number.

**If you're using ROOTS** (drive, direct approaches, expression magic), you want to roll over your number.

**Hit:** 3+ dice succeed. You describe how your action was effective or successful. It reveals an unforeseen benefit or extra effect.

**Success:** 2 dice succeed. Describe how your action was successful or effective.

**Good Effort:** 1 dice succeeds. Describe how your action was only partly successful or effective.

**Miss:** No dice succeeds. Your attempt is uneffective or you are unable to succeed. Describe how things went wrong and add a complication.

**Call of the WILD:** you roll exactly your number. You heed the Call of the Wild, getting special insight into what's going on. Ask the GM a question and they'll answer you honestly.

Some good questions:
-   What are they really feeling?
-   Who's upset about this?
-   How could I help them to \_?
-   Whose perspective is not represented in the room?
-   What should I be on the lookout for?
-   What's the best way to \_?
-   What's really going on here?
-   What do my ancestors say about it?

## Facilitate the Game

Play to find out how to help the community overcome its challenges.

Introduce a new issue by hinting at what sort of problems it is causing.

Show signs of trouble before it breaks out and when it's about to happen, then ask the characters what they do.

"There's been a perceptible shift in the population and placement of a lot of insect life lately. What do you do?"

"Your PAD has been acting up over the past couple of days - everyone's PADs have, as a matter of fact. What do you do?"

Call for a roll when a situation is challenging. Don't pre-plan outcomes, let things happen. Use shortcomings to drive the narrative. The situation always changes after a roll, for good or ill.

Ask questions and build on the answers. \"How much do you know about the World Before?"
